The tree canopy was derived by Remote Sensing software using City of Calgary Orthophotos and Lidar. The resulting data was then quality controlled and edited using various photogrammetric and processing tools. TREE_CANOPY_2022 was created by updating TREE_CANOPY_2020 photogrammetrically using the 2022 Digital Aerial Survey (DAS) aerial imagery. Trees and large shrub areas over 2m tall are captured in this dataset.</p> Community Crime Statistics <p>Data is provided monthly by the Calgary Police Service. This data is considered cumulative as late-reported incidents are often received well after an offence has occurred. Therefore, crime counts are subject to change as they are updated. Crime count is based on the most serious violation (MSV) per incident.</p>"}]}
